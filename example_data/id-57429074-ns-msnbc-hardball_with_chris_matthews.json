Thank you, Kathleen Parker.\r\n\r\n\r\nAdvertise\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\tAnd just a reminder.  Rand Paul will be here on HARDBALL, or rather, \r\nwe`ll be with him on Friday.\r\n\tComing up, Hillary Clinton heads back to South Carolina where Barack \r\nObama beat her by close to 30 points. Will the base of the party, meaning \r\nAfrican-American voters, give her a better reception there today?\r\n\tPlus, Rick Santorum announces he`s running for president.  He finished \r\nsecond behind Mitt Romney in 2012, but he`s got a lot of competition on the \r\nreligious right this time, and you better believe it, including Marco \r\nRubio, who`s out there warning that Christianity could soon be labeled hate \r\nspeech because of the pressure to support gay marriage.\r\n\tAnd \"The Washington Post\" reporter on trial for espionage in Iran.  \r\nThe trial has begun in secret, for (ph) his brother is coming to us \r\ntonight.  And I`ve got the button on.\r\n\tFinally, \"Let Me Finish\" with a salute to the country`s number one \r\nRepublican whistleblower.  That`s Rand Paul.\r\n\tAnd this is HARDBALL, the place for politics.\r\n\t(COMMERCIAL BREAK)"

A state-run news agency reported yesterday \r\nthat he maintained his innocence throughout the trial.  \r\n\tAnyway, the State Department has called the charges absurd and has \r\ncalled for Rezaian`s release.  An article in \"The New York Times\" suggests \r\ntoday that his imprisonment might be more about leverage than about \r\njustice.  Quote: \"If history is a guide, his fate may be tied to Iranian \r\npolitical tensions and calculations in the estranged relations between Iran \r\nand the United States that may have nothing to do with the accusations, \r\naccording to political experts, relatives of prisoners and former \r\nprisoners.\"\r\n\tI`m joined right now by Ali Rezaian, the brother of Jason Rezaian.  \r\n\tWhat do you think it`s about?  Do you think it`s politics, something \r\nto do the nuclear deal, something to do with geopolitics?"

Authorities \r\nshielded the defendants with bed sheets as they were loaded on to police \r\nvehicles.  One of the executive`s wives was reportedly crying in the hotel \r\nlobby during the raid.  \r\n\tWell, the arrests were part of a bombshell 47-count criminal \r\nindictment unsealed today by U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch, FBI \r\nDirector James Comey and IRS investigations chief Richard Weber in a \r\nmassive case that has rocked the world`s most popular sport.  \r\n\tWell, the scale and scope of this case is enormous.  It alleges a 25-\r\nyear scheme of bribes, kickbacks, racketeering, fraud, and money laundering \r\ninvolving that sport`s governing bodies, marketing executives and financial \r\nintermediaries.  Fourteen people have been charged.  Six additional guilty \r\nconvictions have been unsealed.  \r\n\tOn top of all that, Swiss authorities announced they were \r\ninvestigating possible criminal wrongdoing involving Russia`s winning bid \r\nto host the World Cup in 2018 and Qatar`s bid to host it in 2022.

In fact, when word came that the Justice Department \r\nwas investigating corruption in FIFA, I think a lot of people just assumed, \r\nwell, they have got to be talking about the `18 and `22 bids.  \r\n\tBut what came out here today was, it was much broader. I mean, they \r\nsaid listen, it`s not just about one or two bids.

I`d like to salute the \r\ncountry`s number one Republican whistle-blower, Rand Paul.  \r\n\tYou see, you don`t have to agree with libertarianism to see the guts \r\nthat it takes.  It means smashing through all the obligations, the right or \r\nthe left, applies to government and saying, guess what, I`d rather not.  \r\nI`d rather have no government than what you`re offering here.  \r\n\tAnd so, it`s not surprising that the country`s lone libertarian \r\npresidential candidate is the one Republican with the courage to call out \r\nhis party for the disastrous route this government has taken since the \r\nweeks after 9/11, when Dick Cheney and the neocons found a route to Iraq, a \r\nroute to the draftee mind of a president, a complicit mainstream media, and \r\na public dog trained to believe whatever a president says about national \r\nsecurity.  \r\n\tJust tell me if you ever heard the phrase that sold us into that Iraq \r\nwar, by the way -- WMD, homeland, regime change.  The vocabulary of war, \r\nthe strange foreign phrase is meant to incur in us some deep need to \r\nattack, and to hate any country that saw the nuttiness in it.  Remember \r\nfreedom fries?  We weren`t even supposed to say French fries, because that \r\ncountry thought the war talk stupid.  \r\n\tAnd here we are a dozen years later, and still, even now, the \r\nRepublican Party has one lone candidate who stands out there being \r\ntruthful.  Rand Paul is like the skinny, quiet uncool kid who doesn`t get \r\npicked for the intramural squad because he dares to think for himself.  \r\n\tWell, the Republicans like Bobby Jindal can mock Paul.  I think he \r\ndeserves credit for his guts.  His father got whacked by Rudy Giuliani for \r\ndaring to challenge the stupid hard Iraq war.  Let`s see if the Republican \r\npeanut gallery roars as loud when some dimwit goes after Senator Paul this \r\ntime.  The war was bad.  \r\n\tIf the Republicans want the White House, the first thing they have to \r\ndo is confess the horrible decision they had the last time they had it.  \r\n\tHillary Clinton called her support for the war a mistake.  I dearly \r\nhope she means it.\r\n\r\n\r\nAdvertise\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\tExcept for Rand Paul, the Republicans haven`t gotten that far.  \r\n\tRand Paul will be here, by the way, on Friday to play HARDBALL.  \r\n\tAnd that`s HARDBALL for us, for now.
